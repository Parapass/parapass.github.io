        <h1>Beginnings</h1>
        <p>Soft drinks began as a replacement to hard drinks, like liquor and alcohol. They were marketed to people in order to stop the hard drinking habits of others.</p>
        <p>Soft drinks first began with mineral water. It was very popular amongst European and Latin American consumers.</p>
        
        <p>The first marketed soft drink came to life in the 17th century as a mixture of lemon juice and water sweetened with water. The company Compagnie de Limonadiers gained a monopoly on it and began selling it. This product today is called lemonade.</p>
        <p>Carbonated beverages were developed by Europeans to imitate the water of famous springs, which have a natural, theraputic value.</p>
        <p>English scientist Joseph Priestley is credited with being 'the father of the soft drink industry' as he conducted experiments on carbon dioxide with water to make carbonated water.</p>
        <p>Thomas Henry is credited with making the first batch amount of carbonated water using 12 gallon barrels based on Priestley's design.
            Jacob Schweppe read the studies of Priestley and decided to make something similar to his device. By 1794 he was selling highly carbonated mineral water to his friends, then later started a business in London.
        </P>
        <p>By 1820, improvements in the manufacturing process had improved and allowed more output, and bottled water had become popular. Mineral flavors, like ginger, lemon, and tonic were added.</p>
        <p>In 1886, John Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta, would invent Coca-Cola.</p>
