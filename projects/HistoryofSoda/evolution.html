        <h1>Evolution</h1>
        <p>After Coca-Cola was invented, many people started opening up shops to sell copycat formulas due to the sheer popularity of it. One of these competitiors is Pepsi-Cola.</p>
        <p>Pepsi-Cola was invented by a pharmascist named Caleb Bradham, who was hoping to recreate the success of Coca-Cola. The drink instantly became a hit, in which Bradham soon founded Pepsi-Cola.</p>
        <p>After many years of being the second best choice to Coca-Cola, hard times fell on the Pepsi-Cola when World War I came along and bumped up sugar prices.</p>
        <p>Bradham soon took a big gamble, and decided to buy a lot of sugar with all of his money because he feared the prices would go even higher.</p>
        <p>Unfortunatly, sugar prices fell from $0.22 per bag to $0.02 per bag soon after he bought it. Bradham had to give away the company to investor Roy Megargel after going bankrupt.</p>
        <p>Now in complete control, Megargel gave his own company a loan and moved offices to Richmond, Virginia, however his reign over Pepsi-Cola would not last long due to the Great Depression.</p>
        <p>When it went bankrupt, Roy Megargel telephoned Charles Guth, the current owner of Loft, Inc. that sold chocolate candy and soft drinks. They formed a new corporation, the Pepsi-Cola Company. </p>
        <p>Loft's quickly replaced all of their soda fountains wih Pepsi-Cola, which led to lower sales, but Guth didn't want to give up on the company.</p>
