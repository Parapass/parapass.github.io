Don't talk if you're not gonna say much
You could have something you don't like the taste of
Don't talk if you won't make it worth it
Did you get far before you hit the surface?
Neuron burst with the four-digit pin code
Eat your words when it doesn't match the skin tone
So blue, no sight, yellow brick road
That's for the worst, don't come back to San Francisco
Live and let live, let 'em figure it out (uh-uh)
We can do whatever, I just want you around (mm-hmm)
Tell that to the world when I don't pick up your calls
And if you're thinking something stupid, don't say nothing at all
Don't talk if you're not gonna say much
(If you're not gonna say)
You could have something you don't like the taste of
(You don't like the taste of, yeah)
Don't talk if you won't make it worth it
(If you won't make it worth it)
Did you get far before you hit the surface?
('Fore you hit the sur—, 'fore you hit the sur—)
And if you don't say something
I'm just gonna dig myself deeper
I wish it could have gone a little cleaner
And if you don't say something
I'm just gonna dig myself deeper
But most of us aren't good with that either
Don't talk if you're not gonna say much
You could have something you don't like the taste of
Don't talk if you won't make it worth it
Did you get far before you hit the surface?
